## Explanation Summary

Purpose: The program is a command-line interface (CLI) application for managing student records, including adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and summarizing student data, with persistence using a CSV file.
Structure: It uses a StudentGradeManager class to encapsulate all functionality, with methods for each operation (e.g., add_student, view_all_students, save_data).
Key Features:

Data Validation: Ensures valid inputs (e.g., marks between 0 and 100, non-empty IDs and names).
Persistence: Uses CSV to save and load student data, ensuring data is not lost between sessions.
User Interaction: Provides a clear menu-driven interface with error handling and user feedback.
Calculations: Computes GPA on a 5.0 scale and assigns letter grades based on GPA ranges.
Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs, file errors, and interruptions gracefully.
