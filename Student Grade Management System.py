Student Grade Management System (CLI Version)
A comprehensive system to manage student records with CSV persistence
"""
# This docstring provides a high-level overview of the program's purpose.
# Why: Helps developers and users understand the script's functionality.

import csv
# Importing the csv module to handle CSV file operations.
# Why: CSV is used for persistent storage of student data, allowing data to be saved and loaded.

# Importing the os module to check file existence and handle file operations.
# Why: Needed to verify if the CSV file exists when loading data.

from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple
# Importing type hints for better code readability and type checking.
# Why: Enhances code maintainability and helps catch type-related errors during development.
